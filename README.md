# 🌸 Iris Classifier (Decision Tree)

## 📘 Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning example using Python and associated Python libraries used for AI/ML in the real world. It builds a decision tree classifier using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) to predict species in the classic Iris dataset. The goal is to demonstrate a simple yet powerful ML pipeline—from data loading to model training.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up and run the classifier locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shibz-git/iris-classifier.git
cd iris-classifier
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train.py
