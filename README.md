# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Classifier (Decision Tree)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning example from the ** AI Engineering traineeship  **. It builds a decision tree classifier using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) to predict species in the classic Iris dataset. The goal is to demonstrate a simple yet powerful ML pipelineâ€”from data loading to model training.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up and run the classifier locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shibz-git/iris-classifier.git
cd iris-classifier
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train.py
